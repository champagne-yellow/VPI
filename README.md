# Virtual power inspection (VPI)

## Overview
This project is a virtual power inspection scene created with Unreal Engine. It includes a total of three scenarios, as shown in the following figure. We collected 2,000 synthetic data in these scenarios for training the semantic segmentation model. Researchers in power line detection can build upon our scenes to expand target types and enrich weather conditions. In addition, we have also provided the code for generating the dataset.
